# metes-and-bounds
Some tools for making surveys and maps.  

I love maps.  Metes and bounds are an old system used to describe the boundry lines of lands (real estate).  Basically you start at a point-of-begining, (such as the corner of an old stone-wall) and then proceed in such a direction (30 degrees 7 minutes 8 seconds West of North) for such a distance (300 links) than proceed in this other direction for some distance so forth.  Follow this process until the boundry is closed and any waypoints are fully constrained by the inital position and the directions followed to get there.

This project is to make tools to use coordinates combined with metes and bounds and various other inputs and measurements to make maps for walking the boundry of your farm etc.  

Outputs could be something like KML (using SimpleKML?) that you could view in Google Earth, Google Mymaps, Bing Maps, or perhaps we can get to more complete maps using the Google Maps API.  But we will need to see the best way to make useable maps that are fun for walking the land while taking advantage of GPS.
