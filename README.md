# metes-and-bounds
Some tools for making surveys and maps.  

I love maps.

Metes and bounds are an old system used to describe the boundry lines of lands (real estate).  Basically you start at a point-of-begining and then proceed in such a direction for such a distance than proceed in this other direction for some distance.  Follow this process until the boundry is closed and any waypoints are fully constrained.

This project makes tools to use GPS coordinates combined with metes and bounds and various other inputs and measurements to make hany maps for walking the boundry of your farm etc.  

Outputs could be something like KML, or peraps more complete maps.  But we will need to see the best way to make useable maps that are fun for walking the land.
